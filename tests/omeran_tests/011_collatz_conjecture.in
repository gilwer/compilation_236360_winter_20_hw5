// testing the collatz conjecture with some values
// The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows:
// start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows:
// if the previous term is even, the next term is one half the previous term.
// If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1
// The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.
